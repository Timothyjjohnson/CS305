Artemis Financial is a financial company that needed help reviewing and improving the security of their software system. Their main concern was making sure their software was safe from vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches or system compromise.

I was responsible for identifying any weaknesses in their software and improving the code so it followed secure coding practices. I think I did well spotting vulnerabilities and explaining how to fix them. Secure coding is important because it protects sensitive data and builds trust with users. When software is secure, it also reduces the chances of future issues that could cost time and money.

One of the hardest parts was understanding the full scope of the vulnerabilities and learning how to prioritize which ones needed attention first. At the same time, this part helped me get better at reading through code carefully and understanding real-world security risks.

I improved the security layers by fixing poor coding practices, input validation issues, and areas where encryption was missing. In the future, I would use tools like OWASP ZAP or static code analyzers to scan for vulnerabilities and figure out what to patch first.

After updating the code, I made sure it still worked correctly and tested it to confirm that no new bugs or vulnerabilities were introduced. I double-checked everything with secure coding standards and testing tools to make sure the final version was both safe and functional.

Practices like validating user input, using strong encryption, and writing clear, organized code were all useful. Tools like SHA-256 hashing and vulnerability scanning helped too, and Iâ€™ll definitely use those again in future projects.

For future employers, I would show this project as proof that I know how to find and fix security issues in software. It shows that I understand how to assess risk, code securely, and think like a developer who cares about protecting users and data.
